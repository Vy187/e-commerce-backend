# e-commerce-backend

## Description
This application is a prototypical back-end for an e-commerce application. In it's current iteration, there is no accompanying front-end but endpoints can be tested with an API client like Insomnia, Postman or Paw. E-commerce is a massive global industry that permeates all aspects of the global economy and understanding the associated datastructures is essential for any fullstack developer. This is a narrow window into the world of the massive ecommerce sites that allows you to understand databases and manipulate data.
